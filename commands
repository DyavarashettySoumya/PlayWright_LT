npm init playwright@latest
add extension for the project (playwright for the VS Code) one done you can see the symbol
then add the "headless:false," in the playwright.config.ts file in "use" block after two lines
"Headless" mean we cant see the execution-it will happen at background
"above line is for we can see the execution while executing the cases"


selenium--within the time elements are not reacting while regression
playWright--a bit faster while reacting the elements
=>playwright will wait inbuily 30sec while finding the elements,and it will show the error message in code itself 
=>cross browser testing is there no need to write the code(inbuilt feature is there)
-------------------test case template-----------------
/*
test('test case title',async({page})=>{
//page=mean no need to mention any browser
//async--inbuilt wait method
test steps

})
*/

--------------------locators----------------
using attribute
[attribute='attributeValue']
-------------------xpath implementation------------
xpath by the value----------------//tagname[@value='1']
xpath by the attribute name-------//tagname[@attribute='attributeValue']
------------if the values are changes simultaniously then follow below xpath type--------
----parent and child tags---
//tagname[@attribute='attributeValue']//following-sibling:td[6]
//td[@headers='attributeValue']//following-sibling:td[6]


------------------------------soft and Hard assersion-----------------
soft--->TC should should thrown an error message in cosole(try/catch method)
compile will not stop
Hard--->when the test case fail it is called hard assersion(expect method)
hear complier will stop the execution
